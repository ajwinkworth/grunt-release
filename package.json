No! What's wrong with you? Automate all that:\n\n```shell\ngrunt release\n```\n\nDone. No more github issues reminding you how often you forget to do one or more of the steps.\n\n## Setup\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-release --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-release');\n```\n\n## Using grunt-release\n\n**Patch Release:**\n```shell\ngrunt release\n```\nor\n```shell\ngrunt release:patch\n```\n\n**Minor Release:**\n```shell\ngrunt release:minor\n```\n\n**Major Release:**\n```shell\ngrunt release:major\n```\n\n## Options\nYou can disable any of the steps if you want, by adding this to your Gruntfile:\n\n```js\n  release: {\n    options: {\n      bump: false,\n      add: false,\n      commit: false,\n      tag: false,\n      push: false,\n      pushTags: false,\n      npm: false,\n      config: false\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n## Credits\nInspired by Vojta Jina's [grunt-bump](https://github.com/vojtajina/grunt-bump).\n\n## License\nMIT",
